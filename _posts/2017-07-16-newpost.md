 from a single markdown source file. As for content I used a blog post that I published on Huffington post few months ago.
This workflow was performed  through a single Bash script in which I could easily execute multiple commandes to convert multiple document formats to each other.
The **unfamiliar** black command line page can be intimidating at first but when you unerstand it and get used to it, you realize how easy and efficient it is. Workflow and automation can be done in the command line environment so effortlessly and efficiently. You really do not need to have access to any fancy software to be able to create multiple file types from a simple plain text format. 
 I'm *sure* I'll make use of this skill in the future.
